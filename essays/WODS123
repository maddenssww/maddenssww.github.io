After completing all three “BrowserHistory WODS” I am delighted that I can say I am more confident in HTML and CSS. I did struggle with Google developer tools for a bit, but after watching the screencasts and consulting the internet for help, I was able to finish the WODS within 2-3 tries. I didn’t use LiveReload as much as I had anticipated but even without it I managed to finish all WODS in under 10 minutes. VSCode has become a lot easier since my practice and I can quickly type commands into my terminal and the workspace. What usually takes After doing WOD 3, I noticed that I had an error, after quickly scanning through my code I was able to find my mistake. This was a moment I was particularly proud of since the last couple of times I made an error I would blank out and consult someone for help. The first WOD “BrowserHistory1” was probably the most difficult for me since it was my first WOD, required a lot of code, and had multiple steps that were challenging to complete under the Rx time. 

I feel these WODS are challenging but also intellectually stimulating- as a person who loves puzzles and things of the sort, I enjoyed trying to complete a task accurately under a time limit - all while filming my work and narrating my steps. I think it is beneficial to try the WODS without timing or recording yourself to alleviate the pressure and just focus on completing the task. After attempting I would recommend watching the screencast or consulting AI if there’s a part you don’t understand or doesn’t work. From there I would recommend trying the screencast and timer while you work on it for a second time. If needed, you can record it a third/fourth time. By doing this, I felt like I wasn’t “cheating myself out of learning” by watching the screencast first. since I had attempted them on my own. I had found on multiple occasions (especially with BrowserHistory 2 and 3) that the screencast gave extra tips and steps to help make the webpage look more put together and clean.
