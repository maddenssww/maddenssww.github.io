For this WOD (Invoice 1), I coded an invoice that would load when I ran my server, this invoice contained five items with costs, quantity, and tax. 
(https://github.com/maddenssww/ITM352_S24_repo/tree/main/WODS/Invoice1)

I tend to make silly mistakes that lead to issues when I run my code. For example, I sometimes forget a bracket or a semi-colon. Or I try to run my server from an individual folder and not my main repository (this was the largest mistake I made this week, which in hindsight is an easy fix and silly). From there, I have some aesthetic problems such as adding an unneeded divider or making my font size too small. While completing Invoice 1, I fond that typing emmet abbreviations and using find and replace come more naturally and when new variables were declared, I knew where to put them and where I would execute the code that contained them. 

As I continue this course, I am starting to fall into a routine when I do the WODS. I have a rhythm of doing the WODS by myself first, watching the screencast and redoing code as needed, and then recording myself for the final attempt. It has now become a matter of increasing speed, accuracy, and efficiency (which I hope to increase by the end of this course). 

I put too much pressure on myself to finish within the average time the first time I attempt the WOD. I think going forward I need to not time myself or check the clock to ensure I just focus on completion. In addition when I watch the screencast for help after attempting, I should pause the video after each step and complete it verses watching the entire screencast and trying to copy from memory.
