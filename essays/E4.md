## Improvement

My programming skills have seen significant enhancement during this course. Specifically, I've noticed improvements in writing clean and efficient code. For instance, initially, I struggled with understanding the concept of functions and their practical application. However, through consistent practice and reviewing examples, I now grasp their importance and can effectively implement them in my programs. Additionally, my understanding of variables and data types has become more nuanced, allowing me to write more robust and error-free code.

## Needing More Work

Despite progress, there are areas where I need to focus on improvement. One such area is finding my errors. While I've become more adept at identifying mistakes, I still struggle with efficiently debugging my code when I run into an issue. To address this, I plan to dedicate more time to studying techniques and leveraging resources like chat, online tutorials, and peer collaboration.

## WODs and Their Impact:

Working on WODs (Workout of the Day) has been instrumental in my learning journey. Initially, I relied heavily on the provided screencasts to complete WODs. However, with practice and repetition, I tackled them independently, relying less on external guidance. This newfound confidence boosts my problem-solving abilities and reinforces key concepts covered in class.

## Labs and Confidence Building:

The lab assignments have played a crucial role in solidifying my understanding of coding concepts. Through hands-on practice, I've gained confidence in applying theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios. Completing labs independently has instilled a sense of accomplishment and preparedness for more challenging assignments.

## Transitioning from Assignment 1 to Assignment 2:
The experience gained from completing Assignment 1 has laid a strong foundation for tackling Assignment 2. While Assignment 1 presented its challenges, it provided valuable insights into project management, code organization, and time management. Armed with this experience, I feel better equipped to tackle the complexities of Assignment 2 with a structured approach and enhanced problem-solving skills.

## Suggestions for Improvement:
Reflecting on the course structure, I believe incorporating more interactive sessions or workshops would enrich the learning experience. Additionally, providing supplementary resources such as coding challenges or case studies could further reinforce learning objectives and foster a deeper understanding of complex concepts.

## Most Helpful Aspects of the Class:
Among the various elements of the class, WODs, labs, and the class website have been particularly beneficial. My favorite aspect of class is the ability to collaborate with classmates and seek one-on-one help when needed. Both have proven invaluable in clarifying doubts and reinforcing learning objectives.
